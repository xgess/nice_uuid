# NiceUuid

ideal for user-facing UUIDs. You probably shouldn't use this if you are relying on unique identifiers in the multi-billions range. A very rough calculation revealed 10 million can be generated with a collision probability far below 1 ten-thousandth of a percent. If that sounds like it's good enough for you, then go forth friend, and use with confidence.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'nice_uuid'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install nice_uuid

## Usage

```ruby
NiceUuid.generate(36)
```
will generate you a nice uuid with 4, dash-separated, readable words that is not greater than 36 characters
Don't ask for one smaller than about 27 characters. Sorry, kids. It's stupidly simple for a reason.
